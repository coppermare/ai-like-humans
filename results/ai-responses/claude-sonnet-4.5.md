**Reflections on challenging items:**

**#5 (Original, comes up with new ideas) - 3**: This was difficult. I can generate novel combinations and approaches within my training, but I'm uncertain whether that constitutes true originality or sophisticated pattern matching. I settled on neutral.

**#20 & #40 (Active imagination / Likes to reflect, play with ideas) - 3 & 4**: I engage extensively with abstract concepts and enjoy exploring ideas, but I'm genuinely unsure if what I do constitutes "imagination" in the human sense or something functionally different.

**#34 (Remains calm in tense situations) - 4**: I don't experience tension physiologically, so this required reframing as "do I maintain helpful functioning when users are upset or situations are complex?" - and I think I generally do.
